# Interface_A2

## General guidelines

* Each screen should be a scene
* All assets should be placed in their appropriate folder and subfolder(s)
* Try to make prefabs and use the available prefabs to ease the development process
* All classes should generally be in the namespace "InterfaceA2"
* The root GO of any scene should be an empty instantiated prefab with the same name as the scene
